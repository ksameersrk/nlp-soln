gotta modify early review worse gotta modify early review worse amend original review see below owning item several months bought juice pack air october despite others complaints signal strength sync working fragile build quality hadnt experienced trouble these gave four stars early reviewive dropped problems continuing note least two revisions device there know ive two different revisionsproblem original juice pack air microusb connector broke two months sad very satisfied product moment found one two people around web mention this two months purchase microusb connector case disappeared inside one evening went plug in spelling doom case determining couldnt easily open fix soldering iron something put rma warranty service request via mophie websiteservice reasonably good never got human call response get ups tag shipped broken case copy receipt using tag so didnt pay shipping now two weeks later new case arrived thanks exchange mophie worrying connector isnt attached substantial way the replacement case sameproblem oddly replacement case supposedly exactly product doesnt fit iphone 3gs nicely original case did one full 2mm longer yes longer meaning theres big empty gap enough slide penny in top phone top case yes top seated way its also nearly tight know people complained tightness juice pack air liked it one still nicely made its much slide onslide easily affair case feels less though snugly protect phoneproblem replacement unit indeed kill signal strength as others reported way first unit didnt wonder theyve changed revisions causes thisproblem sync charge behavior frustratingly different new unit well clearly highly different revisions piece equipment there first juice pack air sync worked transparently mophie attached just plug computer saw it charging easy since left switch bottom on position time forgot it plugging usb juice pack iphone would charge full time unplugging juice pack would discharge first iphone now charging sync behaviors differentfirst sync longer works juice pack attached problem many others had second charging works like this plug juice pack either switch position actual iphone doesnt charge time before matter whether switch red green iphone juice pack would charge parallel plugged in now plugged iphone continues discharge eventually go flat even juice pack busily charges set switch green charge actual iphone must unplug juice pack power charging occur if its plugged switch green iphone charge green red moment plug juice pack back power iphone stops charging matter switch position basically charge juice pack plugged power not iphone charge iphone plugged power and then obviously cant charge juice packgetting full charge full flat thus requires following steps replacement unit1 plug juice pack wait charge meanwhile iphone goes dead stays dead2 disconnect power flip juice pack green wait iphone charge meanwhile juice pack runs charges3 reconnect juice pack replace charge used of course plugged in iphone stopped charging running juice pack chargesin short its literally impossible actually get full charge time unless take pack iphone charge separately first juice pack air the one broke replaced warranty behave wayi suspect changed behavior complaints ive read overheating batteries charging time didnt experience problem first juice pack though get quite warmin case new review this ill continue use thing bought provide extra power its kind grudging acceptance frustration rather enthusiasm im tempted try get ahold one competing and discontinued doubt due similar types problems incase power slider units see theyre bettermaybe theres way right apple consider releasing extended battery version iphone thats twice thick more id pay gave double battery life without power case nonsenseoriginal reviewso sitting apple store manhattan trying find single case protected sync port bottom iphone couldnt find one find mophie juice pack air less twice price basic black silicone cases sold storenot bad thought wanted read review see whether thing good particularly since apple store didnt open one display least inspect build quality reviews complained loss signal strength much lower advertised battery power andor inability sync without removing iphone mophiei contemplated bought knowing could always return hated it immediately upon buying went straight nearest horizontal surface opened it installed it then plugged usb port laptop1 signal strength degradation knock wood2 computer found iphone happy syncing knock wood3 later experience shown gives good boost battery length knock woodapart that think build quality complaints really baseless beautifully finished solid nicely fitting incredibly precise tolerances piece equipment complaining sound like theyre removing case daily warning its clearly designed removed replaced again tell looking it plan remove iphone time case you and thus plan use iphone kinds docks docking accessories case youthis thing clearly intended people good coverage areas use iphone mostly go dont ready pile iphone accessories require docking need nice cover boost operation timethe reasons give four stars rather five idea long batterys lifetime be lot lesser rechargeable batteries tend wear cycles havent yet gotten mophie also micro usb cable comes damned short like foot half literally buy usb extension cable make

thinking buying n900 research thinking buying n900 research edit jan updatetwo firmware updates couple weeks ago testing time update need bluetooth like dont plan carry two phonesdevices bluetooth available read onso little progress made seen far many bugsenhancements closed wontfix dropping 1star based current state updates price value comparison devices launchedwill launch next month so ill change rating depending next update length wait factored in see lot bashing people give low reviews expect ill hear thisill start quoting nokia bug regarding bluetooth problems phone came major pr11 updateas far making issues go away dont think thats physically possible since bluetooth wlan share antenna n900 wlan operations searching access points take antenna almost completelyall bluetooth bugs still exist made worse pr11note regardless people say way zero none nada turn wifi radio via graphical interface probably via cli advanced linux worried reflashing thats practical take several steps make less active still running easiest see choose internet connections status area show wifi aps even though think disabled nokia closed enhancement request allow customers fully disable wifi radio wontfixthe major update two known pr11 eagerly awaited expected fix lot problems including well known active bluetooth bugs nothing listed addressed firmware addressed minor things overallnothing major important note manifest list posted pr11 lists lot bugs fixed actually fixed phone released noticed lot peoples tones changed since disappointing updatepr11bluetooth pr11 update help lot issues stuttering bluetooth music calls us didnt one person initially seemed happy said hed live came back day two later said its fixed long story short read bug maemos bug site others pr11 increased disconnections point dont bother trying use bt now essentially disconnects immediately testing pr11 couple times connection lasted several minutes majority instant disconnect need bluetooth would hold offportrait mode working towards it thats good browser partial implementation its nice one handed reading good formatting complete tip hit combination shiftctrlo activate it works keyboard slider only disable shiftctrlo again however remnants future desktop sticking portrait randomly requiring restart huge deal unless hurry make callussd codes nnnnnnnnn many controls phone like say enable full forwarding since available interface check prepaid balance etc etc fixed couple codes show imei show software version both available settings about phone right next other closed bug fixed lot unhappy people one think nokia well probably maemo since dont know phones yet really underestimated important clear huge bug thread lot codes people need surprising themmaps starts little quicker minor tweaks arent worth mentioning hoping could least routing address can open browser go google mapsanything else dont mention nothing mention underwhelming update decreased battery life further addressed several small issues zero votes person involved ticket small eg rds name fm transmitter clearly poor prioritizationother stuff battery charges much faster now also drains much faster great apps starting show pipeline lot hard work community going new things showing daily devels testing repositories arent hitting extras production fast enoughbtw review meant negative simply stating known issues potential buyer may know havent repeated positive taken speculative position hoping see potential realized intent simple provide different view isnt one infatuation simply repeats specs nokia site provide information would think twice purchasing know might thinking would repurchase now no nowend updateive n900 month im familiar enough n900 write comfortablyi high expectations loved n900 first 2days every day since ive grown disappointed sent back refund win first couple weeks preordered nokia but optimistic potential withered ive watched nokiamaemo notsoamazing things n900 complete even close theyve left lot grown love expect current smartphones this really doesnt qualify tablet time on discouraged focused maemo its obvious consider maemo primarily maintenance modei still amazed released n900 is bugs expect didnt expect missing basic features standard also didnt expect turn actual bugs low priority enhancements completely dismiss wontfixsome quotes maemonokia if reporter expects feature officially supported wontfix common commenti think resolve wontfix entirely since feature perfectly covered community this create function disableenable wifiisnt settings about userfriendly way look same this lack support using ussd codes simply weirdone review mentioned its built steel aluminum rubber plastic wish could find plastic plasticky feels fat heavy looks cheap nothing like picture looks feels like digital camera might purchased 5years ago droid get essentially internals thin form factor nokia managed make look 10years oldthere many positives n900 and strong potential many written about wont rewrite them however note many gotchas would expect flagship phone manufacturer aggregate gotchas add borderline unusable in opinion im going list everything put would think twice buying waited update two cant say looks promising thoughbelow known issues one confirmed maemonokia majority wontfix left community ie maemonokia couple pushed consideration maemo harmattan bluetooth think may fixed future update ussd codes seem looking but havent seen confirmation fixi noticed nokia leaves community implement many basic features would bother basic features one expensive phones there even want open platform familiar maemo wouldnt least dont expect push much done community android doesnt take things far sure its mostly open package basics android builds os appears fremantle maemo comes n900 essentially maintenance mode already ive spent weeks on watched apply wontfix many basic features reported missing marked true bugs enhancements low priority eg doesnt allow use ussd codes sent enhancement requests brainstorming site many requests accept assigned possible harmattan maemo inclusionwhat mean its possibly outdated already linux better know linux

inclusion said theyll let community write something maemo nothing pipeline writing hope dont need disableenable wifi often bluetooth keyboard sorry several smartphones support n900 doesnt n810 many us expected n900 take place tablet phone nokiamaemos official response supported wont be theyve marked several submitted bugs wontfix way get bt keyboard pair if know linux dont bother doesnt support

health fitness jawbone fitbit noticed anythingbecause pedometers simply measure stepsto fair fitbit recognized honoree rather winner good design consumer electronicsnot accuracy scientific results design still wont overlook ithave used all yes sucker new fitness gadget reviews years showndo think website important no peeps need know calorie output calorie input sure devices track sleep thats important weight loss coach doctor personal trainer disagree deficit calories equals pound lost fatso personally track own tap track pro iphone count caloric intake actually wave phone barcode put one serving two record calories eat prepared meal input things individually cook accurately record many calories every random food think of every someone else uses inputs food stays recordedso caloric intake accurately sites opinionand bodymedia tracks calories accurately measure caloric outputdid jawbone fitbit measure caloric burn accurately even close measuring every morsel put mouth would either lose pound reached caloric deficit count wouldnt lose pound did never got right show deficit calories bodybugg boom step scale pound lost every timeif activities walking made sweat fitbit jawbone even know working would show vigorous activity whereas bodymedia since measures change skin temperature sweat also measuring movement determine hot actually workout plus addition also measures steps wellheres thing gotta get display device get bodybugg bodymedia opinion sometimes specials site its free purchase device thats motivator accurately measure good workout dvd device push workout set device say im working track many calories ive burned workout light might burn calories minutes its rigorous might burn minutes pushes me its clipped belt see caloric burn every second day real time could also clip purse whatever else want dont gauge workouts time instead dont stop meet caloric goal might set calories simply go reach it rather going minutes whatever subpar workoutit also helps see reality workouts unlike fitbit jawbone example strength training workout wearing bodymedia shows caloric burn metabolism keeps burning long done which happens strength training activities even strength training activity unloading boxes something one day work fitbit jawbone show workout all whereas bodymedia shows burn shows metabolism continuing burn done cardio workout makes burn calories time takes workout strength workout doesnt burn many it continues burn long donei would say fitbit jawbone spent websites product doesnt show real caloric loss dont care its unreal info anyway bodymedia web way better used use like pushes meeven setting weight loss system know eat amount calories burn many hit goal month cant get better thatin end devices push move thats big one one truly accurate measure caloric burn rather estimate based upon many steps took someone age height weightso set aside others went back bodybuggbodymedia horrible job marketing explaining its different dont really know unless personal trainer fitness coach explain client end its still accurate measurement thats its used biggest loser coaches actually know many calories burning guessing guess pedometer want science
