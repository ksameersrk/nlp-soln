Data centers provide a view of innumerable computing resources. But for many years power consumption has been a major setback for the data centers. An important issue for the existing data centers is to reduce energy consumptions and at the same time not degrade their performance. Data centers have power requirements, which increases by 25% annually. Among the various components of a data center, storage is one of the biggest energy consumers. Storage devices already account for 27% of power consumption at a data center. The focus of our project is on Swift, a multi tenant, highly scalable and durable object storage system that was designed to store large amounts of unstructured data at low cost via RESTful HTTP API. This project aims at simulating these operations of Swift and computing the power consumed in doing so. Once this framework has been set up, different algorithms can be tried on it in order to reduce the power consumption.
